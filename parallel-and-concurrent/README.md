# Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell

_Simon Marlow_

## 1 Introduction

**Parallelism** is about programs that carry out multiple computations simultaneously using a multiplicity of computational hardware. **Concurrency** is a "program-structuring technique in which there are multiple _threads of control_". Computations are carried out during overlapping time periods.

The tool `threadscope` (https://wiki.haskell.org/ThreadScope) allows for performance profiling of parallel Haskell programs.
