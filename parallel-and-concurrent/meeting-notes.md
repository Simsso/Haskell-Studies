# Meeting Notes

Nix: https://github.com/Gabriel439/haskell-nix

## Open Questions

* Can the same name be evaluated multiple times or is it guaranteed to be evaluated at most once?

## Homework

* Write a program that GC's a spark.
* Write a program taking five parameters, a b c d e, s.t. the output is `SPARKS: (n)(a converted, b overflowed, c dud, d GC'd, e fizzled)` (compiled w/o optimization).
